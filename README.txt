The Arca U.S. Treasury Fund, and its tokenized shares ArCoin, is the first blockchain leveraging registered '40 Act Fund that invites the industry to reimagine the traditional financial ecosystem. In creating ArCoin, Arca Labs aims to modernize how ‘40 Act fund shares can be held and transferred by inserting blockchain technology.

OVERVIEW
The Arca U.S. Treasury Fund (the “Fund”) is the first of its kind—a closed-end fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “40 Act”) that issues its shares as digital asset securities transferable through the Ethereum Blockchain.

The Arca U.S. Treasury Fund provides investors and enterprises access to a managed portfolio consisting primarily of U.S. Government bills and notes, traditionally one of the least volatile U.S. asset classes, that is subject to the regulatory requirements under the 40 Act. The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities, which include bills, bonds, and notes issued by the U.S. Treasury (“Treasury Securities”). Assets not invested in Treasury Securities may be held in cash or cash equivalents (including registered money market funds that operate in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act). Under normal circumstances, the Fund will have a maximum average portfolio duration of zero to eight years and a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of between zero and five years.
